# US-AUTO Epic Registry

## Purpose
This registry is the durable epic-level source of truth for the US-AUTO automation epic.
It records which `US-AUTO-*` stories exist, how they relate to one another, which story artifact to open next, and the most conservative current status supported by committed repository evidence.

## Scope
Use this registry to track the minimum portfolio-level facts for the epic:
- story ID
- title
- short summary
- story type
- current status
- origin / relationship to other stories
- primary story artifact reference
- notes about uncertainty, splits, cancellation, or supersession

The registry does **not** replace story bundles.

## Status Legend
- Planned
- Bundle Drafted
- Bundle Ready
- In Progress
- Blocked
- In Review
- Implemented
- Docs Only
- Split
- Cancelled
- Superseded

## Type Legend
- implementation
- docs-only
- follow-up
- enforcement
- split
- governance

## Current Epic State

### Stable Layer (working)
- US-AUTO-1 → US-AUTO-7
- US-AUTO-17
- US-AUTO-19
- US-AUTO-21
- US-AUTO-22

### Gaps (blocking efficiency)
- US-AUTO-18 — operator UX missing
- US-AUTO-23 — change ledger missing

### Next Recommended Story
1. US-AUTO-23 — change ledger
2. US-AUTO-18 — operator UX
